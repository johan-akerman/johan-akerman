### Hello! 
I am Johan, a computer science student with an interest in design and tech who likes to build stuff.
- 🎙️ Currently building [Spotify Transcripts](https://github.com/johan-akerman/SpotifyTranscripts), a tool that uses speech recognition to generate subtitles for podcasts.
- 👋 My favourite "completed" project is [Greet](https://github.com/johan-akerman/Greet), a marketplace where you get paid to refer friends to tech jobs.
