### Hi, I'm Johan ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science student at Lund University who likes to build things! 

- ðŸ”§ I'm currently working on two things:
  1) A website for Volta Greentech, a startup that reduces methane emissions from cows. [View progress here](https://johan-akerman.github.io/VoltaGreentech/).
  2) [Homerun](https://github.com/johan-akerman/homerun), a data visualization tool for the Stockholm real estate market.
- ðŸŽµ My favourite completed project is [Spotify Topics](https://github.com/johan-akerman/SpotifyTopics), a timestamp based navigation system for podcasts.
- ðŸ“« Got any questions or ideas? Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-akerman/)
