### Hello! 
I am Johan, a computer science student with an interest in design and tech who likes to build stuff.
- 🎙️ Currently building [Spotify Transcripts](https://github.com/johan-akerman/SpotifyTranscripts), a tool that uses speech recognition to generate subtitles for podcasts.
- 👋 My favourite "completed" project is [Greet](https://github.com/johan-akerman/Greet), a marketplace where you get paid to refer friends to tech jobs. 
- ✉️ Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johan-akerman/) if you have any questions or ideas that you would like to discuss!
